                <p>I was born in Hong Kong in the year of 2002 and lived there for 15 years 
                    before attending High School in Adelaide. I moved to Brisbane in Year 10
                     and I've been living here since! I can speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin
                      fluently at expert level so feel free to talk to me in any of those languages!

                <h2>Why did I choose CS?</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose computer science as my major because it 
                    fuels my passion for innovation and problem-solving 
                    in a tech-driven world. Its versatility, job prospects, 
                    and the constant learning opportunities excite me, making 
                    it a practical and fulfilling choice.</p>

                <p>In my free time I enjoy going to the gym and improving myself
                     both physically and mentally, being at the gym everyday allows me
                      to filter out stressful things in life and relax my mind. I am
                    also quite a big gamer and I enjoy fps games like VALORANT, CS:GO, 
                    Apex Legends etc. Listening to music is also a big part of my life as 
                    I have my earbuds on while transport, gymming or gaming.
